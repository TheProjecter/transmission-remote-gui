Unfortunately, the typo was made in the project name during creation of the Transmission Remote GUI project on Google Code. The project was named "transmisson-remote-gui" instead of correct "transmiss<font color='red'><b>i</b></font>on-remote-gui".

This page has correct project name, but all development is being performed on the original project page.
